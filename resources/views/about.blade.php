			<h2 class="uk-text">Tri-Cities, Washington</h2>
            <p class="uk-text-large">While most people associate Washington state with rainy, cloudy weather because they are more familiar with Seattle and the westside of the state, they often overlook what the rest of the state has to offer. Furthermore, few people truly realize how vast the wine industry is in Washington or that 99% of the grapes harvested for wine-making within the state are grown far east of the Cascades, where the climate is dry and semi-arid. Currently, the Tri-Cities, which is located in Southeastern Washington and is comprised of the medium-sized cities of Kennewick, Richland, and Pasco, has a fairly minor internet presence within the wine hobbyist community and is often times overshadowed on the larger platforms by more popular wine regions, such as California’s Napa and Sonoma valleys. However, coupled with Walla Walla, another important wine community about an hour’s drive due east of the Tri-Cities, the southeastern corner of Washington state has quickly made a name for itself within the wine industry.</p>

			<p class="uk-text-large">Although it is difficult to ascertain how many wine tourists, consisting of both local wine enthusiasts and visiting tourists, frequent Tri-Cities wineries, it is safe to say that unique visitors can be accounted for in the tens of thousands on an annual basis. The Tri-Cities Wine Society, which hosts the annual Tri-Cities Wine Festival, states that there were over 1000 visitors in attendance at the festival’s Gala Tasting just last year. Keeping in mind that this is just a singular wine-tasting event and that there are numerous others in any given year, such as the spring barrel tasting held annually every April throughout the region, suffice it to say that word has gotten out about Tri-Cities wine.</p>

			<h2 class="uk-text">Tri-Cities Wine Hub</h2>
            <p class="uk-text-large">This website was created to fulfill the capstone requirements for an ALM degree from the Harvard Extension School’s Digital Media Design program. The real impetus for this project, however, stems from my personal passion for the wine-tasting hobby and my continual enjoyment of discovering new wines from great wine-makers in Southeastern Washington. My name is Justin Myre, the sole creator and developer of Tri-Cities Wine Hub, and I chose to create this website to fill a void I found on the internet when it comes to tasting wine in the Tri-Cities area, which just so happens to be my hometown. My primary goal was to create a community-focused, feature-rich dynamic web application for not only wine enthusiasts who call Tri-Cities their home but also for those who visit us from abroad. It is my sincerest hope that Tri-Cities Wine Hub can address our wine community’s lack of internet presence for what is otherwise a burgeoning and robust wine region.</p>

			<p class="uk-text-large">Tri-Cities Wine Hub is not intended to just be an informational website about wine or a place where users can rate wines and wineries, but I find that it has the potential to impact the wine tourism and tasting industry in the Tri-Cities by creating a community platform for users who regularly participate or want to participate in regional wine tasting. Although there are many wine tasting applications that Tri-Cities wine enthusiasts can use, and there are easily accessible resources that provide information about the region’s wines and wineries, nothing truly exists as a “hub” to bring all these elements together for this specific wine region in a simplified, cohesive production.  By utilizing a streamlined user interface, Tri-Cities Wine Hub can be the go-to website application for both local and visiting wine tourists who prefer to have all of these application features and informational resources in one website.</p> 

            <p class="uk-text-large">As of now, with my Digital Media Design Capstone now complete, I consider Tri-Cities Wine Hub to be moving into Phase II of development and I am excited to be able to implement a host of additional features, such as a Wine Journal where users save their favorite wines, and more user interconnectivity, such as the ability to share planner itineraries with other users and comment on wineries. I encourage anyone who visits Tri-Cities Wine Hub to create an account and join our little, but soon to be growing, wine community.</p>
